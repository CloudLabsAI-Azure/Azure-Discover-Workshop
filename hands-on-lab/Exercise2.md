## Exercise 2: Migrate your on-premises SSIS using Azure Data Factory

### Task 1: Review the enabled CLR on the SQL Managed Instance

1. First, use the Azure Cloud Shell to retrieve the fully qualified domain name of your SQL MI database. In the Azure portal `https://portal.azure.com`, select the Azure Cloud Shell icon from the top menu.

   ![The Azure Cloud Shell icon is highlighted in the Azure portal's top menu.](media/1.62.png "Azure Cloud Shell")

1. In the Cloud Shell window that opens at the bottom of your browser window, select **PowerShell**.

   ![In the Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell window, PowerShell is highlighted.](media/1.63.png "Azure Cloud Shell")

1. In the You have no storage mounted, click on **Show advanced settings**.

   ![](media/sad2.jpg "Azure Cloud Shell")

1. Provide the following details and click on **Create storage (4)**.

   - Resource group: **Azure-Discover-RG-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (1)**
   - Storage account: **cloudshell<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (2)**
   - File share: **blob (3)**

   ![](media/sad3.jpg "Azure Cloud Shell")

1. After a moment, a message is displayed that you have successfully requested a Cloudshell and be presented with a PS Azure prompt.
 
   ![In the Azure Cloud Shell dialog, a message is displayed that requesting a Cloud Shell succeeded, and the PS Azure prompt is displayed.](media/1.64.png "Azure Cloud Shell")

1. At the prompt, retrieve information about SQL MI in the SQLMI-Shared-RG resource group by entering the following PowerShell command.

   ```powershell
    $resourceGroup = "SQLMI-Shared-RG" az sql mi list --resource-group $resourceGroup
   ```

   >**Note**: If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, and the account you are using for this hands-on lab is not your default account, you may need to run `az account list --output table` at the Azure Cloud Shell prompt to output a list of your subscriptions. Copy the Subscription ID of the account you are using for this lab, and then run `az account set --subscription <your-subscription-id>` to set the appropriate account for the Azure CLI commands.

1. Within the above command's output, locate and copy the value of the `fullyQualifiedDomainName` property. Paste the value into a text editor, such as Notepad.exe, for reference below.

   ![The output from the az sql mi list command is displayed in the Cloud Shell, and the fullyQualifiedDomainName property and value are highlighted.](media/1.65.png "Azure Cloud Shell")

1. Return to SSMS on your **legacysql2008** VM, and then select **Connect** and **Database Engine** from the Object Explorer menu.

   ![In the SSMS Object Explorer, Connect is highlighted in the menu, and Database Engine is highlighted in the Connect context menu.](media/1.76.png "SSMS Connect")

1. In the Connect to Server dialog, enter the following:

   - **Server name**: Enter the fully qualified domain name of your SQL managed instance, which you copied from the Azure Cloud Shell in the previous steps.
   - **Authentication**: Select **SQL Server Authentication**.
   - **Login**: Enter `contosoadmin`
   - Â **Password**: Enter `IAE5fAijit0w^rDM`
   - Check the **Remember password** box.

1. Select **Connect**.

1. In Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, select **New Query** from the SSMS toolbar.

   ![The New Query button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/1.78.png "SSMS Toolbar")

1. Next, copy and paste the SQL script below into the new query window. This script verifies that CLR is enabled for the managed instance.

    ```sql
    EXEC sp_configure 'clr enabled';
    GO 
    ```

1. To run the script, select **Execute** from the SSMS toolbar.

   ![The Execute button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/1.79.png "SSMS Toolbar")
