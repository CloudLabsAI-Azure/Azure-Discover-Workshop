## Exercise 3: Migrate your on-premises SSIS packages using Azure Data Factory
Duration: 90 minutes

Now that the databases for the Tailspin Application have been migrated, there is a set of additional SSIS packages on the LEGACYSQL2008 server that also require migration to the SQL Managed Instance for the central Data Warehouse. In this exercise you will migrating the SSIS packages to SQLMi using SSDT tools and Azure data factory SSIS integration runtime. 

### Task 1: Review the already enabled CLR on the SQL Managed Instance

1. On the legacysql2008 VM, Open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, click on **New Query** from the SSMS toolbar.

   ![The New Query button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/1.78.png "SSMS Toolbar")

1. Next, copy and paste the SQL script below into the new query window. This script verifies that CLR is enabled for the managed instance.

    ```sql
    EXEC sp_configure 'clr enabled';
    GO 
    ```

1. To run the script, select **Execute** from the SSMS toolbar.

   ![The Execute button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/1.79.png "SSMS Toolbar")

1. The output should display the CLR is enabled for the manged instance.

### Task 2: Prepare SSIS Demo

In this task, you will be running a powershell script that will restore a SSIS packages DB into the SQLMI and install the required SSIS tool for the package migration. 

1. Navigate back to JumpBox, type **PowerShell** in the search bar, right-click on **Windows PowerShell ISE** and click on **Run as administrator** in the context menu.

   ![The Execute button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/1.80.png "SSMS Toolbar")

1. If prompted, click **Yes** to allow the app to make changes to your device.

1. Click on **File** menu and then click on **Open** to open a PowerShell script.

   ![The Execute button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/1.82.png "SSMS Toolbar")
