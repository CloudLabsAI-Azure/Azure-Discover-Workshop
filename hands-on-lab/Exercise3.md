## Exercise 3: Migrate and run your webapp on Azure using the Database Migration Service

In this exercise, you use the **Azure Database Migration Service** here `https://azure.microsoft.com/services/database-migration/` (DMS) to migrate the `WideWorldImporters` database from an on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database into an Azure SQL Managed Instance (SQL MI). WWI mentioned the importance of their gamer information web application in driving revenue, so for this migration, the online migration option is used to minimize downtime. Targeting the **Business critical service tier** here `https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/sql-managed-instance-paas-overview#managed-instance-service-tiers` allows WWI to meet its customers' high-availability requirements.

> The Business-Critical service tier is designed for business applications with the highest performance and high-availability (HA) requirements. To learn more, read the Managed Instance service Tiers documentation.

### Task 1: Create an SMB network share on the LEGACYSQL2008 VM

In this task, you create a new SMB network share on the legacysql2008 VM. DMS uses this shared folder for retrieving backups of the `WideWorldImporters` database during the database migration process.

1. On the LEGACYSQL2008 VM, open **Windows Explorer** by selecting its icon on the Windows Taskbar.

   ![The Windows Explorer icon is highlighted in the Windows Taskbar.](media/1.121.png "Windows Taskbar")

1. In the Windows Explorer window, expand **Computer** in the tree view, select **Windows (C:)**, and then select **New folder** in the top menu.

   ![In Windows Explorer, Windows (C:) is selected under Computer in the left-hand tree view, and New folder is highlighted in the top menu.](media/1.122.png "Windows Explorer")

1. Name the new folder **dms-backups**, then right-click the folder and select **Share with** and **Specific people** in the context menu.

   ![In Windows Explorer, the context menu for the dms-backups folder is displayed, with Share with and Specific people highlighted.](media/1.123.png "Windows Explorer")

1. In the File Sharing dialog, ensure the **DemoUser** is listed with a **Read/Write** permission level, and then select **Share**.

   ![In Windows Explorer, the context menu for the dms-backups folder is displayed, with Share with and Specific people highlighted.](media/1.124.png "Windows Explorer")

1. In the **Network discovery and file sharing** dialog, select the default value of **No, make the network that I am connected to a private network**.

   ![In the Network discovery and file sharing dialog, No, make the network that I am connected to a private network is highlighted.](media/1.125.png "Network discovery and file sharing")

1. Back on the File Sharing dialog, note the shared folder's path, ```\\LEGACYSQL2008\dms-backups```, and select **Done** to complete the sharing process.

   ![The Done button is highlighted on the File Sharing dialog.](media/1.126.png "File Sharing")

### Task 2: Change the MSSQLSERVER service to run under the sqlmiuser account

In this task, you use the SQL Server Configuration Manager to update the service account used by the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service to the `DemoUser` account. Changing the account used for this service ensures it has the appropriate permissions to write backups to the shared folder.

1. On your LEGACYSQL2008 VM, select the **Start menu**, enter "sql configuration" into the search bar, and then select **SQL Server Configuration Manager** from the search results.

   ![In the Windows Start menu, "SQL configuration" is entered into the search box, and SQL Server Configuration Manager is highlighted in the search results.](media/1.127.png "Windows search")

   > **Note**: Be sure to choose **SQL Server Configuration Manager**, and not **SQL Server 2017 Configuration Manager**, which does not work for the installed SQL Server 2008 R2 database.

1. In the SQL Server Configuration Managed dialog, select **SQL Server Services** from the tree view on the left, then right-click **SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)** in the list of services and select **Properties** from the context menu.

   ![SQL Server Services is selected and highlighted in the tree view of the SQL Server Configuration Manager. In the Services pane, SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) is selected and highlighted. Properties is highlighted in the context menu.](media/1.128.png "SQL Server Configuration Manager")

   - **Account name**: `DemoUser`
   - **Password**: `Password.1234567890`

   ![In the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) Properties dialog, This account is selected under Log on as, and the sqlmiuser account name and password are entered.](media/1.129.png "SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) Properties")

1. Select **OK**.

1. Select **Yes** in the Confirm Account Change dialog.

   ![The Yes button is highlighted in the Confirm Account Change dialog.](media/1.130.png "Confirm Account Change")

1. Observe that the **Log on As** value for the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service changed to `.\demouser`.

   ![In the list of SQL Server Services, the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service is highlighted.](media/1.131.png "SQL Server Services")

1. Close the SQL Server Configuration Manager.

### Task 3: Create a backup of the WideWorldImporters database

To perform online data migrations, DMS looks for database and transaction log backups in the shared SMB backup folder on the source database server. In this task, you create a backup of the `WideWorldImporters` database using SSMS and write it to the ```\\SQL2008-SUFFIX\dms-backups``` SMB network share you made in a previous task. The backup file needs to include a checksum, so you add that during the backup steps.

>**Note**: If you are already connected to SSMS through legacysql2008 VM skip these steps and continue from step 3.

1. On the LEGACYSQL2008 VM, open **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17** by entering "SQL server" into the search bar in the Windows Start menu.

   ![SQL Server is entered into the Windows Start menu search box, and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17 is highlighted in the search results.](media/1.132.png "Windows start menu search")

1. In the SSMS **Connect to Server** dialog, enter **legacysql2008** into the Server name box, ensure **Windows Authentication** is selected, and then select **Connect**.
   
   ![SQL Server is entered into the Windows Start menu search box, and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17 is highlighted in the search results.](media/1.133.png "Windows start menu search")
   
1. Once connected, expand **Databases** under **LEGACYSQL2008** in the Object Explorer, and then right-click the **WideWorldImporters** database. In the context menu, select **Tasks** and then **Back Up**.

   ![SQL Server is entered into the Windows Start menu search box, and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17 is highlighted in the search results.](media/1.134.png "Windows start menu search")

1. In the Back Up Database dialog, you should see `C:\WideWorldImporters.bak` listed in the Destinations box. This device is no longer needed, so select it and then select **Remove**.

   ![In the General tab of the Back Up Database dialog, C:\WideWorldImporters.bak is selected, and the Remove button is highlighted under destinations.](media/1.135.png)

1. Return to SSMS on your LEGACYSQL2008 VM and select **New Query** from the toolbar.

   ![The New Query button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/1.159.png "SSMS Toolbar")

1. Paste the following SQL script, which inserts a record into the `Game` table, into the new query window:

   ```sql
   USE WideWorldImporters;
   GO

   INSERT [dbo].[Game] (Title, Description, Rating, IsOnlineMultiplayer)
   VALUES ('Space Adventure', 'Explore the universe with our newest online multiplayer gaming experience. Build custom rocket ships and take off for the stars in an infinite open-world adventure.', 'T', 1)
   ```

1. Execute the query by selecting **Execute** in the SSMS toolbar.

   ![The Execute button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/1.160.png "SSMS Toolbar")

1. After adding the new record to the `Games` table, back up the transaction logs. DMS detects any new backups and ships them to the migration service. Select **New Query** again in the toolbar, and paste the following script into the new query window:

   ```sql
   USE master;
   GO

   BACKUP LOG WideWorldImporters
   TO DISK = 'c:\dms-backups\WideWorldImportersLog.trn'
   WITH CHECKSUM
   GO
   ```

1. Execute the query by selecting **Execute** in the SSMS toolbar.

1. In the list of resources for your resource group, select the **Azure-Discover-RG-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** resource group and then select the **wwi-web-<inject key="Suffix" enableCopy="false"/>** App Service from the list of resources.

   ![The wwi-web-UNIQUEID App Service is highlighted in the list of resource group resources.](media/1.45.png "Resource group")

1. On the App Service blade, select **Configuration** under Settings on the left-hand side.

   ![The Configuration item is selected under Settings.](media/1.46.png "Configuration")

1. On the Configuration blade, locate the **Connection strings** section and then select the Pencil (Edit) icon to the right of the `WwiContext` connection string.

   ![In the Connection string section, the pencil icon is highlighted to the right of the WwiContext connection string.](media/1.47.png "Connection Strings")

1. The value of the connection string should look like this:

    ``
   Server=tcp:your-sqlmi-host-fqdn-value,1433;Database=WideWorldImportersSuffix;User ID=sqlmiuser;Password=Password.1234567890;Trusted_Connection=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;
   ``

1. In the Add/Edit connection string dialog, replace `your-sqlmi-host-fqdn-value` with the fully qualified domain name for your SQL MI that you copied to a text editor earlier from the Azure Cloud Shell and replace suffix with value: <inject key="suffix" /> and also change the UserID with `sqlmiuser` and Password with `Password.1234567890`.

   ![The your-sqlmi-host-fqdn-value string is highlighted in the connection string.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-Migrating-SQL-databases-to-Azure/fix/Hands-on%20lab/media/images/9.png "Edit Connection String")

1. The updated value should look similar to the following screenshot.

   ![The updated connection string is displayed, with the fully qualified domain name of SQL MI highlighted within the string.](media/1.49.png "Connection string value")
   
   ![The updated connection string is displayed, with the fully qualified domain name of SQL MI highlighted within the string.](media/1.173.png "Connection string value")

1. Select **OK**.

1. Repeat steps 3 - 7, this time for the `WwiReadOnlyContext` connection string.

1. Select **Save** at the top of the Configuration blade.

    ![The save button on the Configuration blade is highlighted.](media/1.50.png "Save")

1. When prompted that changes to application settings and connection strings will restart your application, select **Continue**.

    ![The prompt warning that the application will be restarted is displayed, and the Continue button is highlighted.](media/1.51.png "Restart prompt")

1. Select **Overview** to the left of the Configuration blade to return to the overview blade of your App Service.

    ![Overview is highlighted on the left-hand menu for App Service](media/1.52.png "Overview menu item")

1. At this point, selecting the **URL** for the App Service on the Overview blade still results in an error being returned. The error occurs because SQL Managed Instance has a private IP address in its VNet. To connect an application, you need to configure access to the VNet where Managed Instance is deployed, which you handle in the next exercise.

    ![An error screen is displayed because the application cannot connect to SQL MI within its private virtual network.](media/1.53.png "Web App error")

### Task 10: Configure VNet integration with App Services

In this task, you add the networking configuration to your App Service to enable communication with resources in the VNet.

1. In the Azure portal `https://portal.azure.com`, select **Resource groups** from the left-hand menu, select the **Azure-Discover-RG-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** resource group and then select the **wwi-web-UNIQUEID** App Service from the list of resources.

   ![The wwi-web-UNIQUEID App Service is highlighted in the list of resource group resources.](media/1.45.png "Resource group")

1. On the App Service blade, select **Networking** from the left-hand menu.

   ![On the App Service blade, Networking is selected in the left-hand menu, and Click here to configure is highlighted under VNet Integration.](media/1.54.png "App Service")

1. On the **Networking** page, click on the **VNet integration** within **Outbound Traffic**.

   ![Add VNet is highlighted on the VNet Configuration blade.](media/1.55.png "App Service")

1. Now select **Click here to configure** under **VNet Integration** and then click on **Add VNet** on the VNet Configuration blade.

   ![Add VNet is highlighted on the VNet Configuration blade.](media/1.56.png "App Service")

1. On the Network Feature Status dialog, enter the following and click **OK**.

   - **Virtual Network**: Select the vnet-sqlmi--cus.
   - **Subnet**: Select the existing subnet. and select any subnet from the drop down menu.

   ![image](media/1.57.png "App Service")

   >**Note**: If you see **Failed to add delegation to existing subnet** please select any other subnet.  

   >**Note**: If you are not able to select any existing subnet, then follow the below steps.
   
   - Select the create new subnet option and enter name as Webappsubnet<inject key="Suffix" />. Select the Virtual Network address block i.e., 10.0.0.0/16 from the drop down list. In the subnet address block enter new address block 10.0.xx.0/23 for the subnet, make sure it is not overlapping other subnet's address.
  
   > **Note**: If the address space is overlapping with other subnets, change the virtual network address block by selecting a different virtual network address block i.e., 10.1.0.0/16 or 10.2.0.0/16 from the drop-down. In the subnet address block, enter 10.1.xx.0/23 or 10.2.xx.0/23 according to the virtual network address block you have selected and make sure it is not overlapping the other subnet's address.

   ![The values specified above are entered into the Network Feature Status dialog.](media/1.58.png "App Service")

1. Within a few minutes, the Vnet is added, and your App Service is restarted to apply the changes. Select Refresh to confirm whether the Vnet is connected or not.

   ![The details of the Vnet Configuration are displayed. The Certificate Status, Certificates in sync, is highlighted.](media/1.59.png "App Service")

   > **Note**: If you receive a message adding the Virtual Network to Web App failed, select **Disconnect** on the Vnet Configuration blade, and repeat steps 3 - 5 above.

### Task 11: Open the web application

In this task, you verify your web application now loads, and you can see the home page of the web app.

1. Select **Overview** in the left-hand menu of your App Service and select the **URL** of your App service to launch the website. This link opens the URL in a browser window.

   ![The App service URL is highlighted.](media/1.174.png "App service URL")

1. Verify that the website and data are loaded correctly. The page should look like the following:

   ![Screenshot of the WideWorldImporters Operations Web App.](media/1.61.png "WideWorldImporters Web")

   > **Note**: It can often take several minutes for the network configuration to be reflected in the web app. If you get an error screen, try selecting Refresh a few times in the browser window. If that does not work, try selecting **Restart** on the Azure Web App's toolbar.

1. Congratulations, you successfully connected your application to the new SQL MI database.
